@article{bakker2004,
	abstract = {A benchmark problem involving the rotating movement of three immiscible fluids is proposed for verifying the density-dependent flow component of groundwater flow codes. The problem consists of a two-dimensional strip in the vertical plane filled with three fluids of different densities separated by interfaces. Initially, the interfaces between the fluids make a 45$\,^{\circ}$ angle with the horizontal. Over time, the fluids rotate to the stable position whereby the interfaces are horizontal; all flow is caused by density differences. Two cases of the problem are presented, one resulting in a symmetric flow field and one resulting in an asymmetric flow field. An exact analytical solution for the initial flow field is presented by application of the vortex theory and complex variables. Numerical results are obtained using three variable-density groundwater flow codes (SWI, MOCDENS3D, and SEAWAT). Initial horizontal velocities of the interfaces, as simulated by the three codes, compare well with the exact solution. The three codes are used to simulate the positions of the interfaces at two times; the three codes produce nearly identical results. The agreement between the results is evidence that the specific rotational behavior predicted by the models is correct. It also shows that the proposed problem may be used to benchmark variable-density codes. It is concluded that the three models can be used to model accurately the movement of interfaces between immiscible fluids, and have little or no numerical dispersion.},

@article{wooding1997b,
	abstract = {The downward convection of salt fingers or plumes developed from the unstable boundary layer of an evaporating ``dry'' salt lake is examined using a numerical model and Hele-Shaw cell experiments. In the convecting layer the early small waves evolve into fingerlike or plumelike formations, the number of fingers or plumes decreasing with time owing to differential growth and/or coalescence. Comparison of intermediate formational stages of this pattern with the pattern generated by a two-dimensional numerical simulation shows good qualitative agreement. However, there is a significant mismatch of the growth rates at long times. In the computer simulation the plume length develops approximately twice as rapidly as it does in the experimental case. A simple numerical experiment independent of the salt-lake boundary conditions is compared to previously published laboratory-scale measures of plume development in Hele-Shaw cells which confirms the retardation of Hele-Shaw plumes by a factor of approximately 50\%. This departure is attributed to the differences in dimensionality between the Hele-Shaw flow domain and the model domain. The data indicated that leading plumes develop isolated behavior at long times and may not be adequately represented in Hele-Shaw analog models, and numerical simulation provides a more accurate simulation of field-scale behavior.},

@article{wooding1997a,
	abstract = {Convective groundwater motion can be generated in aquifers beneath and adjacent to saline lakes. Such motions strongly control the subsurface distribution of salts, the formation of saline minerals, and the distribution of contaminants that may be disposed of in the saline lake. In particular, schemes to use saline lakes as evaporation basins for irrigation waste waters must consider the groundwater dynamics associated with convection. The convection is driven by the evaporative concentration of salts at the land surface, leading to an unstable distribution of density. However, the evaporative groundwater discharge can dynamically stabilize this saline boundary layer and inhibit convection. In this work we investigate the nature and onset of convection for a range of boundary conditions typically found in saline lakes. Processes involved in the accumulation of salt at the surface of a groundwater discharge zone and in the gravitational instability of the near-surface groundwater are considered. Results of theoretical stability analysis are applied through laboratory and numerical experimentation to the more complex geometries typically found in the field. These comparisons indicate that for large saline lakes, the stability of the saline boundary layer can be parameterized by traditional Rayleigh criteria, in which the aquifer permeability and the evaporation rate from the lake bed are principal controlling factors. For typical saline lake environments, convection will dominate in sediments whose permeability exceeds approximately 10−14 m2. Below this threshold permeability, the boundary layer should be stabilized by the evaporative flux, resulting in the accumulation of salts and evaporites at the land surface. These results provide insight into the predictive behavior of groundwater dynamics and solute distributions in many natural systems.},

@article{simmons1999,
	abstract = {Like any other computer model, density-dependent mathematical groundwater models must be ``verified'' to ascertain that they accurately represent the physics implied by a governing set of equations. Very few test cases for density-dependent groundwater numerical models exist. As such, there is still a need for new and more robust tests of these modeling codes. In this paper a numerical model of an idealized evaporating salt lake is produced using the two-dimensional density-dependent saturated-unsaturated transport (SUTRA) model, the results of which are compared with an equivalent laboratory Hele-Shaw cell system developed by Wooding et al. [1997a, b]. Evaporation results in dense brine overlying less dense fluid, which is hydrodynamically unstable and leads to downward convection of salt fingers or plumes. A comparison of experimental and numerical plume growth shows good spatial and temporal agreement. The numerically generated plume pattern is sensitive to changes in random noise level applied just below the evaporation surface that serves as a trigger for the growth of instabilities. Experimental plume patterns were best matched with a noise level corresponding to 1\% of the total salinity difference between boundary layer and background fluid concentrations at saturation. In a second comparison the stream-function-based finite difference model described by Wooding et al., [1997a, b] which differs significantly in principle from SUTRA is shown, after revision, to give good spatial and temporal agreement with experimental results. This test for density-dependent groundwater models appears to be the most comprehensive and detailed available to date.},

It is a mathematical benchmark problem used for code verification of density driven flow simulators and comparison of issues related to its numerical treatment. Its bifurcation diagram with respect to the Rayleigh number is investigated on a hierarchy of uniformly refined grids. Eleven stationary solutions are shown to exist for the Elder problem. Similar solutions can be found using the Boussinesq approximation. Despite this similarity the corresponding bifurcation diagrams are shown to be topologically not equivalent. This gives rise to serious doubts on the validity of Boussinesq approximation for this model problem. Grid convergence is investigated for the numerically obtained solutions.},

	abstract = {The aim of this paper is to clarify and circumvent the issue of multiple steady state solutions in the Elder problem. A pseudospectral method is used to avoid numerical error associated with spatial discretization. The pseudospectral method is verified by comparison to an analytical solution at Rayleigh number, Ra = 0, and by reproducing the three stable steady state solutions that are known to exist at Ra = 400. A bifurcation diagram for 0 < Ra < 400, which is free of discretization error, confirms that multiple steady states are indeed an intrinsic characteristic of the Elder problem. The existence of multiple steady states makes the Ra = 400 Elder problem less suitable for benchmarking numerical models. To avoid the multiple steady states, we propose a benchmark at Ra = 60. The results for this Low Rayleigh Number Elder Problem are presented and compared to simulations with the commercial groundwater modeling package FEFLOW. Correspondence between the pseudospectral model and FEFLOW is excellent.},

@article{doi:10.1029/2006WR005195,
	abstract = {Environmental processes frequently exhibit threshold-type behavior, e.g., the initiation of fluxes such as snowmelt, recharge, and quick flow. Incorporating such thresholds into hydrological models introduces discontinuities into the objective functions used in model calibration, making parameter estimation unnecessarily more difficult. Moreover, this study shows that model thresholds can produce spurious multimodality in least squares objective functions even if the underlying model is near linear in its parameters. In contrast, smoothing the model with respect to its parameters and inputs yields differentiable objective functions and, in some cases, can also improve its macroscale characteristics by removing spurious secondary optima. This simplifies model calibration and sensitivity analysis by reducing the complexity of objective functions and permitting the use of powerful derivative-based analysis methods such as Newton-type optimization and Hessian-based uncertainty assessment. This paper details smoothing strategies for several classes of thresholds and discontinuities commonly found in hydrological models, including step and angle discontinuities in the constitutive functions and flux constraints arising from conservation laws in the governing differential equations. The smoothing algorithms and their parameters are selected to ensure infinite differentiability of the model and its objective functions while preserving the macroscale behavior of the original governing equations. The improvements in the structure of the model and its objective functions are illustrated empirically for a degree-day-based snow model. The smoothing techniques are general and can be applied to other models with thresholds.},
